# U.T.D.

The driving point I want to deliver via this deck is, one of teh recent YouTube videos I watched helped me research more about individuals and roots.
I was also looking for a presentation topic and the video in the references helped me to drive the point for the project and presentation, that is Vectors and N.N. (Neural Networks),
are two solutions to solve business problem.
I have also added Applications in separate slide as an add on to the project, truely discussing the applications for the project for the Applied Deep Learning subject.
